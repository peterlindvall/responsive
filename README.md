# responsive
A skeleton for a responsive website entirely without Javascript

It is meant to be used as a foundation for anyone that for some odd reason wants to create a static website and also have the requirement to make it responsive. 
The images are there for illustration purposes only and are all public domain.

Note: The media query that enables the transitions from the grid layout to the vertical layout suitable for really small screen sizes does not seem to work when the content is fed to the browser from a local directory but it works just fine if it is served by a web server.
